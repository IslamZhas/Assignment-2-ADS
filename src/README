MyLinkedList:


General info: Create head(first, entry point), tail(last node) and size.
Create class Node that includes variable data, which is Generic that refers to data, included in node, and next
that refers to next node.


Methods:
add(T element): It has parameter that gets element,which should be added to node.
if head(first node) is null, the head and tail will store newNode,
else the last node(tail) will store the newNode
Then size will be incremented


get(int index): It has parameter that gets index of element that we want to get.
Create the node that is equal to current node(head),
and through for loop the current will be the node that we needed.
After the loop, this method will return the value of data of node


getSize(): It returns size


remove(int index): It has parameter "index" that shows the index of element that will be removed
If index is equal to 0, the first node(head) will beb replaced by the next
Else create the node that is equal to current node(head)
Through for loop, current will refer to the next. There is "i < index -1", because
the node that is before needed node, will refer to this(node in position of index),
and after loop, the next node after this node(node in index) will refer to next
Because of this, the node in index will be skipped.
Size will be decremented
